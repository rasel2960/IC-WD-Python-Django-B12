10-1. Learning Python:
Open a blank file in your text editor and write a few lines summarizing what youâ€™ve learned about Python so far.
Start each line with the phrase In Python you can. . . .
Save the file as learning_python.txt in the same directory as your exercises from this chapter.
Write a program that reads the file and prints what you wrote two times:
- print the contents once by reading in the entire file,
- and once by storing the lines in a list and then looping over each line.
