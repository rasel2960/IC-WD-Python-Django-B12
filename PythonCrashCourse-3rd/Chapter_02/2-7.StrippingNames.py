# 2-7. Stripping Names: Use a variable to represent a person's name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination "\t" and "\n" at least once. Print the name once, so that the whitespace surrounding the name is displayed. Then print the name using each of these functions: lstrip(), rstrip(), and strip().
name5 = "\t  Rasel Ahmed \n"
print(name5)
print(name5.lstrip())
print(name5.rstrip())
print(name5.strip())
