Exercise 5:
Check if the first and last numbers of a list are the same.
Write a code to return True if the listâ€™s first and last numbers are the same.
If the numbers are different, return False.

Given:
numbers_x = [10, 20, 30, 40, 10]
# output True

numbers_y = [75, 65, 35, 75, 30]
# Output False

- Hint
Use list indexing.
Get the first element of the list.
Get the last element of the list.
Compare these two elements using the equality operator (==).
